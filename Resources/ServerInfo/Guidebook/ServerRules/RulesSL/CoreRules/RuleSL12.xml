  # Rule 12 - Silicon.
 The Silicon Rules override all roleplay rules if there is any conflict. Silicon Rules do not override server rules. Follow rules in order, from smallest to largest number.

 Subparagraphs to this rule:

  - You cannot request or allow a law change.
  - You must remain consistent with your interpretation of laws.
  - ID determines who is station crew. Zombies with ID are still crew members.
