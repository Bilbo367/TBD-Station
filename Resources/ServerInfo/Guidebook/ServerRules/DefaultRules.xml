  # Server Rules
  This server is different than most other servers in that the rules will mostly be enforced via code. What does this mean?

  If you are doing an action that we have determined to be detrimental to the experience we are aiming to provide, you will be punished through smites if you misbehave enough.

  It is highly unlikely that any admins will ever directly smite you, if anything, this will be something that we aim to minimize.

  In order for us to improve the system which we call the karma system, please join the discord and provide feedback. If you think something was unfair, let us know so we can help make your experience here better.

  ## The Rule
  With all that being said, there is a single rule that will be enforced by admins.

  - Do not exploit.

  ## What does exploit mean?
  Anything that is in line with trying to hinder the ability of the server to function as a way to play the game we will count as exploiting the server.

  For example, if you are causing the server to lag, you are causing the server to be unplayable for others.

  Another is if you are spamming in chat and no one is able to say anything, you are actively hindering the ability of players to communicate which is an important aspect of the game itself.

  ## What the heck is a detrimental action?
  An easy example is murdering someone. Unless you are an antagonist, you have little reason to murder anyone. 
  
  There are systems in place so that if players are playing as security officers or any other job that could reasonably murder someone, they have a bit more leeway. 
  
  However, not so much so that any security officer or even command can get away with murder freely.

  ## Important note
  You have the ability to vote on players when you right click them. If you think they are doing a good or bad job feel free to vote accordingly.
